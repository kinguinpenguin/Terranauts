GAME IDEA - TERRANAUTS

Start on Mars, similar opening to The Martian (terraforming team, storm, everyone left but you because they thought u dead)
Repair the base and stuff
Save point in shelter + your rover
Water frozen in the ground in small quantities underground, but you need to go north to get the frozen ice caps for giga water
You have a multi tool like Starbound, can dig and build, needs to be upgraded
When you run out of water, you start taking damage but you don't die, you go to very low hp plus sluggish
If you die, starbound ahh animation that respawns u either at the shelter or ur rover (last save)
Three difficulties: No water/hunger and shit (easy), Water/hunger but when you die you keep your stuff (normal), When you die your stuff is in a backpack you have to collect (Hard)
There will be machines used to terraform the planet, very slow but can make multiple to make it faster.
Terraforming doesn't instantly make it green, you have to import grass and plants and shit from earth (they find out you're alive once you fix the communication, but can't get to you because its too hard but can send stuff)
Can also import animals to farm but they will die if ur not careful
Eventually can add other planets like Europa, but you won't fly there, you'll send a portable shelter with a teleporter
You install a teleporter to your shelter and it takes you there
Will add radiation/cold/heat protection suits required to visit certain planets
Could all multiplayer as well
PVE (?) probably not, astroneer don't have that shit neither
Automation is possible to farm resources, as there'll be deposits of materials
Certain materials on found on certain planets

POTENTIAL BUILDINGS:

Base (Will hold crafting station, default storage lockers, an AI you talk to like Starbound)
Satellites / Windmills (Solar and wind energy respectively)
Sleeping Area
Chemistry Lab
Greenhouse Lab
Rover Platform (Comes with rover)
Water tank (extension to chemistry lab, as you will make water there)
Storage room
Teleporter (Used to import materials from Earth at the cost of energy)
